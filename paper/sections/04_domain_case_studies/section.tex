\section{Domain Case Studies}
\label{sec:cases}
In this section I will be discussing select papers that are relevant to this seminar topic.
Exactly which papers are to be determined. Potential research direction is given below.

\subsection{Aerospace and Remote Science}
Aerospace, Deep Sea wayages etc.

\subsubsection{Psychological and Cognitive Impacts}
I am sure in long isolated voyages the use of a somewhat human-feeling interface is a lot better from a psychological aspect rather than a GUI.
I have found a paper regarding this. It is certainly something I would like to involve in this paper.

\subsection{Emergency and Environmental Response}

\subsection{Industrial Operations}
