\section{Introduction \& Motivation}
\label{sec:intro}

In this section I will be talking about the general topic. Give introduction to what Human Machine Interaction is, what LLMs are and how their use can aid in HMI.
I think I will be taking the \emph{Conversational\_User\_Interfaces\_for\_Astronauts} paper as the base reference.
